# CodeWars challenges

## Task 1

Complete the solution so that it returns true if the first argument(string) passed in ends with the 2nd argument (also a string).

Examples:

    solution('abc', 'bc') // returns true
    solution('abc', 'd') // returns false

## Task 2

A square of squares

You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vain… Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.
Task

Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

    In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.
Examples

    -1  =>  false
    0  =>  true
    3  =>  false
    4  =>  true
    25  =>  true
    26  =>  false

## Task 3

You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.

#Examples:

    Kata.getMiddle("test") should return "es"
    
    Kata.getMiddle("testing") should return "t"
    
    Kata.getMiddle("middle") should return "dd"
    
    Kata.getMiddle("A") should return "A"

#Input

A word (string) of length 0 < str < 1000 (In javascript you may get slightly more than 1000 in some test cases due to an error in the test cases). You do not need to test for this. This is only here to tell you that you do not need to worry about your solution timing out.

#Output

The middle character(s) of the word represented as a string.

## Task 4

Given a list of integers, determine whether the sum of its elements is odd or even.

Give your answer as a string matching "odd" or "even".

If the input array is empty consider it as: [0] (array with a zero).
Examples:

    Input: [0]
    Output: "even"
    
    Input: [0, 1, 4]
    Output: "odd"
    
    Input: [0, -1, -5]
    Output: "even"

## Task 5

Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9), that returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number.
Example

    createPhoneNumber([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]) // => returns "(123) 456-7890"

The returned format must be correct in order to complete this challenge.

Don't forget the space after the closing parentheses!

## Task 6

You might know some pretty large perfect squares. But what about the NEXT one?

Complete the findNextSquare method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a parameter. Recall that an integral perfect square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.

If the parameter is itself not a perfect square then -1 should be returned. You may assume the parameter is non-negative.

Examples:(Input --> Output)

    121 --> 144
    625 --> 676
    114 --> -1 since 114 is not a perfect square

## Task 7

Implement a function that accepts 3 integer values a, b, c. The function should return true if a triangle can be built with the sides of given length and false in any other case.

(In this case, all triangles must have surface greater than 0 to be accepted).

## Task 8

Given an array of ones and zeroes, convert the equivalent binary value to an integer.

    Eg: [0, 0, 0, 1] is treated as 0001 which is the binary representation of 1.

Examples:

    Testing: [0, 0, 0, 1] ==> 1
    Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2
    Testing: [0, 1, 0, 1] ==> 5
    Testing: [1, 0, 0, 1] ==> 9
    Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2
    Testing: [0, 1, 1, 0] ==> 6
    Testing: [1, 1, 1, 1] ==> 15
    Testing: [1, 0, 1, 1] ==> 11

However, the arrays can have varying lengths, not just limited to 4.

## Task 9

The rgb function is incomplete. Complete it so that passing in RGB decimal values will result in a hexadecimal representation being returned. Valid decimal values for RGB are 0 - 255. Any values that fall out of that range must be rounded to the closest valid value.

Note: Your answer should always be 6 characters long, the shorthand with 3 will not work here.

The following are examples of expected output values:

    rgb(255, 255, 255) // returns FFFFFF
    rgb(255, 255, 300) // returns FFFFFF
    rgb(0,0,0) // returns 000000
    rgb(148, 0, 211) // returns 9400D3

## Task 10

Implement the function unique_in_order which takes as argument a sequence and returns a list of items without any elements with the same value next to each other and preserving the original order of elements.

For example:

    uniqueInOrder('AAAABBBCCDAABBB') == ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'A', 'B']
    uniqueInOrder('ABBCcAD')         == ['A', 'B', 'C', 'c', 'A', 'D']
    uniqueInOrder([1,2,2,3,3])       == [1,2,3]

## Task 11

Write Number in Expanded Form

You will be given a number and you will need to return it as a string in Expanded Form. For example:

    expandedForm(12); // Should return '10 + 2'
    expandedForm(42); // Should return '40 + 2'
    expandedForm(70304); // Should return '70000 + 300 + 4'

NOTE: All numbers will be whole numbers greater than 0.

## Task 12

A Narcissistic Number (or Armstrong Number) is a positive number which is the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits in a given base. In this Kata, we will restrict ourselves to decimal (base 10).

For example, take 153 (3 digits), which is narcissistic:

    1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153

and 1652 (4 digits), which isn't:

    1^4 + 6^4 + 5^4 + 2^4 = 1 + 1296 + 625 + 16 = 1938

The Challenge:

Your code must return true or false (not 'true' and 'false') depending upon whether the given number is a Narcissistic number in base 10.

This may be True and False in your language, e.g. PHP.

Error checking for text strings or other invalid inputs is not required, only valid positive non-zero integers will be passed into the function.

## Task 13

In this kata you should simply determine, whether a given year is a leap year or not. In case you don't know the rules, here they are:

    years divisible by 4 are leap years
    but years divisible by 100 are not leap years
    but years divisible by 400 are leap years

Additional Notes:

    Only valid years (positive integers) will be tested, so you don't have to validate them

Examples can be found in the test fixture.

## Task 14

Given a point in a Euclidean plane (x and y), return the quadrant the point exists in: 1, 2, 3 or 4 (integer). x and y are non-zero integers, therefore the given point never lies on the axes.
Examples

    (1, 2)     => 1
    (3, 5)     => 1
    (-10, 100) => 2
    (-1, -9)   => 3
    (19, -56)  => 4

## Task 15

Given a month as an integer from 1 to 12, return to which quarter of the year it belongs as an integer number.

For example: month 2 (February), is part of the first quarter; month 6 (June), is part of the second quarter; and month 11 (November), is part of the fourth quarter.

Constraint:

    1 <= month <= 12

## Task 16

Wolves have been reintroduced to Great Britain. You are a sheep farmer, and are now plagued by wolves which pretend to be sheep. Fortunately, you are good at spotting them.

Warn the sheep in front of the wolf that it is about to be eaten. Remember that you are standing at the front of the queue which is at the end of the array:

[sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep, wolf, sheep, sheep]      (YOU ARE HERE AT THE FRONT OF THE QUEUE)
7      6      5      4      3            2      1

If the wolf is the closest animal to you, return "Pls go away and stop eating my sheep". Otherwise, return "Oi! Sheep number N! You are about to be eaten by a wolf!" where N is the sheep's position in the queue.

Note: there will always be exactly one wolf in the array.
Examples

Input: ["sheep", "sheep", "sheep", "wolf", "sheep"]
Output: "Oi! Sheep number 1! You are about to be eaten by a wolf!"

Input: ["sheep", "sheep", "wolf"]
Output: "Pls go away and stop eating my sheep"

## Task 17

Given 2 elevators (named "left" and "right") in a building with 3 floors (numbered 0 to 2), write a function elevator accepting 3 arguments (in order):

    left - The current floor of the left elevator
    right - The current floor of the right elevator
    call - The floor that called an elevator

It should return the name of the elevator closest to the called floor ("left"/"right").

In the case where both elevators are equally distant from the called floor, choose the elevator to the right.

You can assume that the inputs will always be valid integers between 0-2.

Examples:

    elevator(0, 1, 0); // => "left"
    elevator(0, 1, 1); // => "right"
    elevator(0, 1, 2); // => "right"
    elevator(0, 0, 0); // => "right"
    elevator(0, 2, 1); // => "right"

## Task 18

Our football team has finished the championship.

Our team's match results are recorded in a collection of strings. Each match is represented by a string in the format "x:y", where x is our team's score and y is our opponents score.

For example: ["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...]

Points are awarded for each match as follows:

    if x > y: 3 points (win)
    if x < y: 0 points (loss)
    if x = y: 1 point (tie)

We need to write a function that takes this collection and returns the number of points our team (x) got in the championship by the rules given above.

Notes:

    our team always plays 10 matches in the championship
    0 <= x <= 4
    0 <= y <= 4

## Task 19

There are pillars near the road. The distance between the pillars is the same and the width of the pillars is the same. Your function accepts three arguments:

    number of pillars (≥ 1);
    distance between pillars (10 - 30 meters);
    width of the pillar (10 - 50 centimeters).

Calculate the distance between the first and the last pillar in centimeters (without the width of the first and last pillar).

## Task 20

You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.
Examples

    [2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36]
    Should return: 11 (the only odd number)
    
    [160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21]
    Should return: 160 (the only even number)

## Task 21

The number 898989 is the first integer with more than one digit that fulfills the property partially introduced in the title of this kata. What's the use of saying "Eureka"? Because this sum gives the same number: 89 = 8^1 + 9^2

The next number in having this property is 135135135:

See this property again: 135=1^1+3^2+5^3 = 
Task

We need a function to collect these numbers, that may receive two integers aaa, bbb that defines the range [a,b][a, b][a,b] (inclusive) and outputs a list of the sorted numbers in the range that fulfills the property described above.
Examples

Let's see some cases (input -> output):

    1, 10  --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    1, 100 --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 89]

If there are no numbers of this kind in the range [a,b] the function should output an empty list.

    90, 100 --> []

## Task 22


## Task 23


## Task 24


## Task 25

Create a function finalGrade, which calculates the final grade of a student depending on two parameters: a grade for the exam and a number of completed projects.

This function should take two arguments: exam - grade for exam (from 0 to 100); projects - number of completed projects (from 0 and above);

This function should return a number (final grade). There are four types of final grades:

    100, if a grade for the exam is more than 90 or if a number of completed projects more than 10.
    90, if a grade for the exam is more than 75 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 5.
    75, if a grade for the exam is more than 50 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 2.
    0, in other cases

Examples(Inputs-->Output):

    100, 12 --> 100
    99, 0 --> 100
    10, 15 --> 100
    
    85, 5 --> 90
    
    55, 3 --> 75
    
    55, 0 --> 0
    20, 2 --> 0

*Use Comparison and Logical Operators.

## Task 26

Your task is to find the nearest square number, nearest_sq(n) or nearestSq(n), of a positive integer n.

For example, if n = 111, then nearest\_sq(n) (nearestSq(n)) equals 121, since 111 is closer to 121, the square of 11, than 100, the square of 10.

If the n is already the perfect square (e.g. n = 144, n = 81, etc.), you need to just return n.

## Task 27

Introduction

The first century spans from the year 1 up to and including the year 100, the second century - from the year 101 up to and including the year 200, etc.
Task

Given a year, return the century it is in.
Examples

    1705 --> 18
    1900 --> 19
    1601 --> 17
    2000 --> 20

Note: this kata uses strict construction as shown in the description and the examples, you can read more about it here

## Task 28

## Task 29

Write a function, which takes a non-negative integer (seconds) as input and returns the time in a human-readable format (HH:MM:SS)

    HH = hours, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 99
    MM = minutes, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59
    SS = seconds, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59

The maximum time never exceeds 359999 (99:59:59)

You can find some examples in the test fixtures.
